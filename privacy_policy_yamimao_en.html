  <h1>Privacy Policy — Yamimao</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-12-15</p>

  <p>Yamimao is an entertainment and well-being app providing personalized readings (astrology, numerology, compatibilities, etc.). This page explains what data is processed and for which purposes. For any question, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:yamimao.app@gmail.com">yamimao.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical data and device identifiers</strong>: IP address, device information, operating system, and advertising identifiers (for example IDFA on iOS and AAID on Android). This data is used in particular for displaying ads (AdMob) and preventing fraud or abuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: events related to how you use the app, performance metrics and crash/diagnostic logs, in order to improve stability and user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>User-provided data</strong>: first name/nickname, date/time/place of birth and preferences, as well as information you enter to receive personalized readings (profile, scores, compatibilities, etc.).  
      Without creating an account, this data may stay locally on the device. If you create a Yamimao+ account or enable cloud backup/sync, parts of this data are stored on our backend (Firebase / Google Cloud) so that you can restore your profile on multiple devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments and subscriptions</strong>: for in-app purchases and subscriptions, transactions are processed by the app stores:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play (Android)</strong> via Google Play Billing;</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store (iOS)</strong> via StoreKit / your Apple account.</li>
      </ul>
      We do not store card numbers. We only receive technical information about the status of your subscription (active, expired, cancelled) so we can unlock the corresponding features in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Purposes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the main features of the app (readings, scores, compatibility, notifications where available).</li>
    <li>Operate the free + subscription model, including showing ads in the free version and unlocking Yamimao+ premium features (for example: removal of ads, extended compatibilities and future premium options).</li>
    <li>Measure usage in an aggregated way and fix bugs, so we can improve performance and content quality.</li>
    <li>Ensure security of the service and prevent fraud or abuse (for example, abusive use of subscriptions or payment systems).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing with third parties</h2>
  <p>We may share some data with the following categories of third parties, only for the purposes described above:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical providers</strong>: Google Firebase / Google Cloud (hosting, database, analytics, notifications), logging and diagnostics services, and other providers strictly necessary to operate the app.</li>
    <li><strong>App stores and payment services</strong>: Google Play Billing (Android) and Apple App Store / StoreKit (iOS) for handling in-app purchases and subscriptions. These services process some data under their own privacy policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal bases (EU/EEA)</h2>
  <p>Where the GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>: providing the app’s core features, generating personalized readings, and managing your Yamimao+ subscription or account.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: security of the app, fraud prevention, aggregated audience measurement, and improving our services.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required, for certain types of advertising or marketing/measurement SDKs (for example, through Google’s UMP consent flow or similar tools).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical and diagnostic logs are kept for limited periods, proportionate to security and maintenance needs, and are then deleted or anonymised.</li>
    <li>Data associated with your profile and Yamimao+ account is stored while your account is active and as long as it is needed to provide the service.</li>
    <li>If you request deletion of your account, your data will be deleted or anonymised, except where the law requires longer retention (for example for accounting or fraud-prevention purposes).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on the applicable law, you may have rights to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>access your personal data;</li>
    <li>rectify inaccurate data;</li>
    <li>erase data (“right to be forgotten”);</li>
    <li>restrict processing;</li>
    <li>object to certain processing;</li>
    <li>receive your data in a portable format where this applies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:yamimao.app@gmail.com">yamimao.app@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for additional information to confirm your identity before acting on your request.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data (encryption in transit, access controls, limited logging, etc.). No system is perfectly secure, but we try to maintain a level of protection appropriate to the risks.</p>

  <h2>8. Account, subscription and deletion</h2>
  <p>If the app allows you to create a Yamimao+ account, you can view and update some information directly inside the app. Subscription management (renewal, cancellation) is handled by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the <strong>Google Play Store</strong> on Android; or</li>
    <li>your <strong>Apple / App Store account</strong> on iOS, in the “Subscriptions” section.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated data from within the app (when this option is available) or by emailing <a href="mailto:yamimao.app@gmail.com">yamimao.app@gmail.com</a>, specifying the e-mail address linked to your Yamimao account. Some strictly necessary data may be kept separately for the period required by law (for example for accounting or security reasons).</p>

  <h2>9. Data transfers outside the EU/EEA</h2>
  <p>Some of our providers (for example Google, Firebase or other technical vendors) may process data outside the European Union or European Economic Area. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses or similar mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>10. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app, our practices or legal requirements. The date at the top of this page shows the latest update. When appropriate, we may also inform you of important changes inside the app or by e-mail.</p>
